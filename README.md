# MPU6050 Sensor Data Display Web Application

## Overview
This project is an application that interfaces with an MPU6050 sensor to retrieve data about roll, pitch, and yaw angles and displays this information on a web page. MPU6050 is a commonly used accelerometer and gyroscope sensor, and this application provides a real-time visualization of the sensor's output through a web interface.
